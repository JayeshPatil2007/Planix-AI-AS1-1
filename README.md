# 🚀 Planix AI  
### The AI Learning Operating System

Turn learning goals into structured execution systems.

AI generates personalized learning roadmaps, teaches concepts, and tracks progress — all inside one intelligent platform.

---

# 🌍 Overview

**Planix AI** is an AI-powered learning operating system designed to help people learn complex skills with structured guidance.

Modern learners face a common problem:

- Too many tutorials
- No clear starting point
- No structured roadmap
- No progress system

Planix AI solves this by transforming a simple goal into a **structured learning architecture**.

Users simply provide:

- A learning goal  
- Available days  
- Daily learning time  

The system then generates a **phase-based learning roadmap** with clear milestones.

---

# 🎯 Problem

Self-directed learning on the internet is chaotic.

Learners often experience:

- Information overload
- Unstructured tutorials
- Lack of direction
- No accountability
- No progress tracking

This leads to **abandoned learning journeys**.

---

# 💡 Solution

Planix AI acts as a **Learning Architect**.

Instead of recommending random content, it **designs a structured progression system**.

The platform:

1️⃣ Converts goals into learning architecture  
2️⃣ Breaks knowledge into phases  
3️⃣ Generates milestones with estimated effort  
4️⃣ Provides AI explanations  
5️⃣ Tracks progress through a dashboard

The result is a **clear path from beginner to mastery**.
